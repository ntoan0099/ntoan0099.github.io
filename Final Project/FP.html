<h1><strong>The Search for Literacy</strong></h1>

<h2>A case study showcases what does literacy actually means</h2>


<p class = "date">December 18, 2024</p>

<p class = "author">Written by Ethan Le</p>

<h3><span class = "text">I</span>ntroduction</h3>

<p>The following interview is conducted with Kayla Carlamere, a senior at Montclair State studying English. Carlamere is 5 feet 10 inches with brown lustful hair. She is an anxiously energetic individual with an inspiring passion for writing. I know Carlamere through our works at an internship and classes we had together. She loves talking about stories and writing prose and screenplays. Carlamere resides in the south of New Jersey, near Atlantic City. She is currently on track to graduate by Winter 2025—and she is very excited.</p>

<h3><span class = "text">I</span>nterview</h3>

<h4>So can you tell me about your first exposure to literacy? Like, tell me about how text or anything related help you understand something beyond your reality. Beyond reality.</h4>

<p>I have a funny story about the first book I was ever obsessed with. Okay. I don't know how old I was, but it was one of those K through 3rd grade readers or something about this dog named Biscuit. It was called “Biscuit's Day at the Farm,” and that was the first time where I just had a book, and I carried it with me everywhere.</p>

<p>And the first time I was re-reading the same story. And I don't know how this that answer your question. That was my first experience with a book and I guess another world where, like I don't know.</p>

<h4>I mean, but that was your first, like, exposure to stories and to fables and stuff. Right?<h4>

<p>Yeah. I'm sure there's other books I read before that but that's, like, one that stands out to me.</p> 

<p>Do you remember the first time you learned how to write? Like when was the first time you learned how to write? And what were your initial reaction?</p>

<p>I don't remember when I fully learned to write, but I do have a very vivid memory at my grandma's house. I, like I guess I was just, like, learning letters, but I would, like, write a bunch of letters in a row and then ask my dad, what does this word mean? And he would tell me, that's not a word. But, like, I guess that was somewhere in there. I know.</p>

<h4>I mean, but that was your first, like, exposure to stories and to fables and stuff. Right?</h4>

<p>Yeah. I'm sure there's other books I read before that but that's, like, one that stands out to me.</p>


<h4>Do you remember the first time you learned how to write? Like when was the first time you learned how to write? And what were your initial reaction?</h4>

<p>I don't remember when I fully learned to write, but I do have a very vivid memory at my grandma's house. I, like I guess I was just, like, learning letters, but I would, like, write a bunch of letters in a row and then ask my dad, what does this word mean? And he would tell me, that's not a word. But, like, I guess that was somewhere in there. I know.</p>

<h4>I mean, were you influenced by something that triggered you to write? Like, to just, like, write out those random words and ask your dad. I mean, like, you have to be influenced somewhere. Right?</h4>

<p>I guess I was just intrigued. That must have been, like, early on learning to write and read, so I think I was just intrigued with words as an idea.</p>

<h4>I see. I mean, do you have any influence from people that show you what writing was or, like, what kind of literacy did they transcend you? A person?</h4>

<p>I like to think of myself as a storyteller. So I always like see my dad as like the person who got me into that. So like storytelling-wise, like also like TV I guess is before writing or reading, but then like once I got into reading stories and writing my own stories, my dad is the person I see as like what got me into that world. I think so.</p>

<h4>Comparing all your experiences in writing from elementary school to high school, do you feel like there's a shift in your attitude toward writing? Like, do you still feel like no. When we are in elementary school, we have to from elementary school to high school, we have to write a lot about essay analysis. Now how your how your attitude, changed, like, going from there?</h4>

<p>So early elementary school, I don't really remember much writing, like school writing. I just remember I wrote a lot of stories, like early elementary school, and then I think the shift when I had to do a lot of academic writing was, like, late middle school, early high school. So I kind of fell out of, like, writing for fun.</p>

<p>So then late high school when I started taking creative writing classes for the first time so, like, I had this passion from when I was much younger now put into, like, the atmosphere of a classroom and I was, like, actually learning the discipline of it. It brought back my passion for that, which I lost throughout, like, academic writing. And now that I'm in college, I've learned to enjoy academic writing because I can, like, weave together things I've learned from, like, creative writing and prose writing and make the whole process more enjoyable.</p> 
 
<h4>Does this feel does this still feel like a chore?</h4>

<p>No. In fact, this semester I had to write two academic essays for my English class, and I had a lot of freedom to, like, use my own voice in it and be creative with, like, the formatting. And so I would say I like academic writing now after it was it was a journey, but I like it now.</p>

<h4>So you're talking about how you're a storyteller, so what kind of writing are you doing now? Like, what influenced you to perform this kind of writing?</h4>

<p>So I definitely started like very cheesy prose writing. I wanted to write like chapter books but I was like in 1st grade so I wrote like 7 pages at a time. I like finished my first, like, poorly written book and I was like so proud of myself. And What was I saying? So I wrote prose a lot and that was the only thing I wrote.</p>

<p>I wasn't ever a fan of, like, poetry, and I also wasn't that much of a fan of a short story. I always had ideas that came to me in, like, such, like, long, long plot lines and I lost my plot. But, yeah. So then in high school, when I took the 1st creative writing class, as I mentioned, we were, like, required to write, like, one first chapter, one short story, one poem. So that, like, broadened my horizons, I guess, to, like, see what else was out there.</p>

<p>And when I came to college, I started screenwriting for the first time, and now that has, like, become my main passion. And I haven't done a lot of prose writing in a while, but it's still, like, always gonna be there as something I see as, like, like a comfort thing that I can always come back to when I'm looking forward to my career.</p>

<h4>I mean your aspiration to be a screenwriter, you know, it's all about writing, about literacy as well. So what do you think is, like, the most influential thing that helped you come to that conclusion?</h4>

<p>So I definitely read books when I was younger, but where like, most of the stories I consumed were always, like, TV shows and movies, especially because of my dad and it was, like, something we did together and something we bonded over.</p>

<p>So that's when I wanted to, like, get into film. I actually came to college as a film major. And that's when I took my first screenwriting class, and I realized I really loved it. And then I got to the production courses of being a film major, and I didn't like them. So that's how I landed on, oh, I wanna be a screenwriter as opposed to anything else in film.</p>

<p>But so screenwriting over prose, it was just my experience with, like, films and how they shaped my childhood as opposed to books. Well, I still love books, but they weren't they were just, like, less of a staple, I guess, in my childhood.</p>

<h4>I gotcha. I gotcha. So, you know, we talk about film and media and stuff like that. Given that, you know, you're talking about how media and film were having a big influence in your life, do you think that now as we go forward, do you think social media will be a big influence in your life as well?</h4>

Like, to gain knowledge and new knowledge, to learn new things, to get influenced by it? I don't know if this is gonna answer that question, but I'm just gonna say something. 

<p>Okay. So I don't use social media a lot, like, personally, but as for, like, certain platforms, like Reddit I thought that's kind of, like, a laughable thing some yeah. So, like, Reddit and then, like, a lot of blogs. That's how I connected with people outside of, like, my dad which was the only person I, like, really communicated with about, like, the stories I like to consume. So through social media platforms, like Reddit and blogs, like I said, if those count, that was how I engaged in, like, these communities and I, like, discovered, like, what a fandom was, and that's also a big reason why I want to be a screenwriter and someday hopefully produce shows and movies is because I've seen the community they can build, and I would love to create something like that.</p>

<h4>So after college, what do you think you're do you still gonna write are you still gonna write screenplay going forward after college? And now what would what would your future about writing be like? What will your writing future look like?<h4>

<p>So I definitely wanna continue with my screenwriting, but my immediate plans after college, I wanna what was he saying? I'm going to build my screenwriting portfolio on the side of working a different job, so I plan on going into book publishing. Because everything I've done, I've chosen to focus around, like, storytelling and building stories, and I took one book publishing class my sophomore year. That made me fell in love with that industry as, like It was my first chance of seeing, like, not the author or maybe the screenwriter, but this whole team that sometimes goes into building a story. Like, the developmental edits and then, like, the marketing and all this stuff is important to getting stories out there for people to consume.</p>

<p>So I plan, hopefully, on getting a job in book publishing as, like, a steady steadier career path while I write on the side. But writing is definitely something that's going to stay.</p> 

<h4>You know, in addition, talk about beyond time here, will you expose your writing to your children? Or younger relatives are just in the general public. Like, how do you feel about that? Like, will you expose them and why?</h4> 

<p>Well, in order to get where I wanna be, I know I have to expose them. Like, I'm not gonna have a show made if I'm never gonna show my script to anyone. But that is something I struggle with now is like sharing my stories with people and not necessarily the judgment, but just, like, it makes it so real once it's out in the world. And yeah. But in the future, I would like to personally get to the point where I feel more open with my storytelling, and I would like them to actually be produced whether it's, like, a published novel or a produced screenplay.</p>


<h3><span class = "text">D</span>iscussion</h3>

<p>Through my conversation with Carlamere, I notice her literacy—her love, her passion for the writings of the arts, stem mostly from her father. As she mentions in her retelling of her backstory, Carlamere speaks fondly of her dad introducing her to many wonders of literacy in the form of movies. He exposed her to world of cinema.</p> 

<p>“I like to think of myself as a storyteller. So I always like see my dad as like the person who got me into that. So like storytelling-wise, like also like TV I guess is before writing or reading, but then like once I got into reading stories and writing my own stories, my dad is the person I see as like what got me into that world. I think so,” says Carlamere when asked about her first-hand experience with finding her literacy. In some shapes or form, her father implicitly guided her toward a career where she enjoyed deeply. Carlamere also mentions about television helped shape her ambition into reality—like she announces to herself, “A storyteller.”</p> 

<p>Carlamere’s backstory with her literacy confirms my intuition: our literacy is dictated by our surroundings, especially by our family.</p>  

<p>Carlemere comments, “So I definitely read books when I was younger, but where like, most of the stories I consumed were always, like, TV shows and movies, especially because of my dad and it was, like, something we did together and something we bonded over.” By having deep social interaction (in this case, a father-daughter activity), literacy is spread from one to another. Her dad’s interests in films and entertainment transcended over to her, leading Carlemere to explore her passion in cinema, more importantly, being a storyteller.</p> 

<p>As mentioned in Deborah Brandt’s essay “Sponsors of Literacy,” “Sponsors are delivery systems for the economies of literacy, the means by which these forces present themselves to—and through—individual learners. They also represent the causes into which people’s literacy usually get recruited”<div class = "cite">(Brandt 167).<span class = "citation">Brandt, Deborah. “Sponsors of Literacy.” College Composition and Communication, vol. 49, no. 2, 1998, pp. 165–85. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/358929. Accessed 18 Dec. 2024.</span></div><p>Being a “sponsor” of literacy increases the chance of individual inheriting values and beliefs from certain practices and learning. In the case of Carlemere, she inherited her passion of films through her father. Her exposure to creatives propelled to find her passion in life, and it was opened by her “sponsor”—her father.</p> 

<p>Carlemere’s father’s influence of literacy even dated back to her early days as a toddler, asking what did certain words mean. However, during the process of asking her dad for the meaning of each word, her father acted as a gatekeeper of information. Thus, he implicitly presented himself as a delivery system for literacy.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, into our conversation, Carlemere reflects back on her journey with writing, from the early years of elementary school to early college. At the beginning, Carlemere showed a high passion for creative writing, yet into years of analytical writing, the school institution slowly killed her passion, making her fell out of it. Until she got into the years of college where her attitude revealed a sudden change—she liked doing both analytical and creative (they both grant her a sense of enjoyment with writing). The result of her enjoying writing more is an unexpected outcome. I was strongly believed that her attitude about essay writing would like a chore, yet she deemed them fun to write about.</p> 

<p>Carlemere expresses desires to pursue more creative works with her writing skills. She wants to work in publishing; however, her real passion is to hone in her screenwriting ability.</p> 

<p>According to “Nutrition, Health, and Wellness at La Escuelaita: A Community-Driven Effort Toward Food and Environmental Justice,” “WE have found food not only acts as a common language, but as Rick Flowers and Elaine Sawn noted in their work on food pedagogy, it enables learning”<div class = "cite">(Del Hierro et al., 31).<span class = "citation">Del Hierro, Victor, et al. "Nutrition, Health, and Wellness at La Escuelita: A Community-Driven Effort Toward Food and Environmental Justice." Community Literacy Journal, vol. 14 no. 1, 2019, p. 26-43. Project MUSE, https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/clj.2019.0023.</span></div></p><p>The authors of the article might refer to literacy to food, but it is no difference from films. They are visual symbols that transcend meaning and it is a universal language. To Carlemere, films and stories are her language to understand more about herself and the world.</p> 

<p>Granted, she barely has any social media influence acted upon her literacy, but with Reddit being her community for ideas, Carlemere participated in literacy exchange. Just like food, creative ideas that Carlemere possesses are universal language for creators—they are visions for fantasy and fable. Those creative ideas are the way for Carlemere to spread her values and beliefs, becoming a sponsor for other to adapt and learn.</p> 

<p>In some ways, Carlemere’s journey concludes the fact that school writing and educational institutions doesn’t really change the what school writing is, but the attitude is shifted due to a higher level of freedom being given. Thus, with more creative decision going into writing and text, school writing becomes less of a chore and more engaging to write about.</p> 

<p>Just like Doctor Jackie Regan, co-founder and co-chair of Text, Power, Telling, Carlemere uses her writing to express an idea, a feeling—even though it might be fictional stories, they still carry a vital message. Carlemere instills her values into her writing, and later on publish them to spread her ideologies to society. Granted, her stories might not be about overcoming sexual abuse, but they infuse with meaning that can help change lives. Stories are powerful in their own ways with their own fable and themes. Ultimately, Carlemere’s literacy is through the medium of storytelling, but they pack with life-lesson potency as she experiences new traditions and feelings through stories. By writing her stories, Carlemere curates a narrative that are filled with her background knowledge and pre-existing values; later, those stories will be spread throughout the public, leading to them learning new values and beliefs, incepted by Carlemere herself.</p>

<h3><span class = "text">L</span>ooking <span class = "text">B</span>eyond</h3> 
 
<p>Through my understanding of Carlemere’s literacy and her perspective on it, I gather that literacy is an exchange of ideas and understanding. Yes, there is still writing and reading involved, but it is more about how information is consumed and adapted. With the study of Carlemere, I deduce the fact that literacy is not embedded only in text, but rather all sort of mediums—from sign and symbols to color visuals. However, there are some limitations regarding the case study with it being a one-person study.</p> 

<p>By having only one sample, the margin of error to form an absolute conclusion is challenging. With many people experience different levels of obtaining literacy. Additionally, most people coin the term “literacy” with association of text, so having different subjects would result in multiple ways to identify what is literacy. However, the question still remains Is literacy obtained through means of text or exchanges of communications and ideas?</p> 

<p>In order to answer this question, a study of two group, one group will be given text materials to understand, while the other is offered discussion and visual aids. At the end of the observation period, the two groups will test how much they learn about the topic. Ultimately, the outcome would be astounding varies since everyone has different experiences with the content, but nonetheless, the margin of errors will narrow, resulting a more concrete conclusion about what exactly is literacy and how we define it.</p> 

<p>Overall, there is no concrete way to measure literacy except learning them through people’s lens. In some way, literacy is still a theoretical idea that appear in many forms. The way people interpret its meaning can be varies from its being definition that associated with text, or some other shapes—literacy is subjective. Everyone has a different opinion. Thus, literacy can never be fully defined by textbook, but in one way or another, everyone has their meaning on literacy and what it means to them.</p>
